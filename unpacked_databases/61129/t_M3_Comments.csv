Cust states her daughter also said that the brakes got very hard and she could not brake either. Cust states her daughter hit a curb on the right side and blew out both right side tires. Vehicle towed to dealership for inspection. Dealer raised vehicle to inspect. No visible damage to steering or body. Damage is to both right side tires, both right side wheels, and 1 rt side hubcap. Damage is on sidewall of tires and outer edge of rims. Dealer connected scanner to vehicle and no codes stored. Dealer placed a loaner set of rims and tires on vehicle and drove for 30 miles with scanner to monitor if any failure of electric steering would occur. Vehicle drove fine. Dealer advised customer that no failure of steering was found . No codes and no defective parts. Dealer also reviewed for any bulletins . No bulletins based on the build date of this vehicle. Dealer discussed with customer that brakes and steering are independent of one another. Electric steering failure would not cause brakes to get hard and any brake issue would not causing steering to lock. In failure of electric steering, manual steering is still present. Cust insists that her daughter would not give her any incorrect information and she is not wanting to turn it into her insurance. She feels Ford should resolve her repairs under a warranty repair. Dealer has advised cust that she needs to contact her insurance."

Damage is on sidewall of tires and outer edge of rims. Dealer connected scanner to vehicle and no codes stored. Dealer placed a loaner set of rims and tires on vehicle and drove for 30 miles with scanner to monitor if any failure of electric steering would occur. Vehicle drove fine. Dealer advised customer that no failure of steering was found . No codes and no defective parts. Dealer also reviewed for any bulletins . No bulletins based on the build date of this vehicle. Dealer discussed with customer that brakes and steering are independent of one another.

Apparently there is a lot of trouble, but this wasn't told about this. ..The veh is currently in NL, she doesn't have the VIN. ..She took her veh to a Ford dlrshp and they keep telling her it's $2300. ..Before going into the dlrshp, the veh was very hard to steer, used excessive effort. ..She is seeking fin assist.....She's aware that there's already a lot of issues with these rack and pinions. She knows other people that have had them replaced. She's only had the veh for a few years. It's not her issue that there's no warranty. She has to go work. ..She had a part replaced that was under warranty and after that the power steering went. This veh has caused her nothing but problems. She would never recommend anyone to get a Ford Fusion. ..It's so far out now because she didn't have the finances to fix it. When this first happened, no one said there was certain conditions. She really wants it fixed. ..She wants to speak to someone who can cover this for her. She wants to speak to a manager. She doesn't care what she's being told, she still wants to speak with a manager. She can be called at 709-222-1222.....PER CUST, DLR SAYS..N/A....CRC ADVISED..After exhausting all resources, at this current time there are no more existing warranties or after warranty programs we have in effect addressing the concern your are experiencing and providing coverage. ..What I am still doing here today is forwarding this info to engineering who will further review this info with other collected data we've received from other calls. If they notice a trend or pattern, this may result in a recall or additional program to be placed on your veh. If you have a program placed on your veh, you will receive a letter in the mail addressing what your authorized dlr will be doing and that this will be covered for you, including parts and labor. Now if you have paid for this prior to receiving the notification letter, you would just need to submit your receipts to the SM who will review and expedite reimbursement.....Advised that she is outside of all warranty just about. Your powertrain warranty expired at 100,000 km, you are 28,000km outside of warranty. We are responsible with providing you a quality product, and when your veh has issues, we provide you with a warranty to take care of any defects you may experience. You are responsible for the warranty as well. You put the miles on the veh, not Ford. There are no programs or warranties anybody can use to assist with covering this cost. If there was any help, I would have sent you somewhere to get it, but you are outside warranty and no one here can appeal this denial. It is Ford's final answer.....Advised that I will get you to a supervisor. Please note that they have to work within the same warranty guidelines as myself and they can't overturn this decision. Now please allow them enough time to thoroughly review your case since they have cases ahead of yours. They will contact you back within the next 2 business days...Your case number is CAS-5046947-B5G6V6."

In late 2013 I was in an accident and the front right steering rack had to be replaced. The vehicle was sent to Wayside Ford In Marlboro MA for repair. Once finished I had to ok. The car never turned the same until one day recently in September in went out completely. Had to have it towed and only after research I realized I could use the bumper to bumper warranty to help. Upon inspection of the vehicle I was told that the same steering rack that Wayside Ford had replaced was also defective. The same establishment replaced the defective steering rack. But now I have no coverage on a part I am to assume to work as before and for all I know may be useless in less than a year and I am to be responsible for that? Also when this happened I was lucky enough to be in a parking lot and not on the highway or this situation could have ended a lot worse..WHAT ACTION HAS YOUR DEALER TAKEN TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE?:Nothing said that there was no warranty on the replaced replacement part. Offered no apology for originally installing a defective part in the first place..WHAT ASSISTANCE ARE YOU SEEKING FROM FORD MOTOR COMPANY?:Some type of communication with me to assure me that 1.) This will happen again and 2.) That there is some type of protection for the repairs should they fail again..Are you the owner of the vehicle :Yes.VIN : 3FAHP0JA4CRXXXXXX.MILEAGE : 26500.WHERE IS YOUR VEHICLE NOW : InPossession.HAVE YOU CONTACTED THE DEALER :Yes.DEALER NAME : Wayside Ford..Contact Information.First Name : (REDACTED).Last Name :(REDACTED).Address :(REDACTED)..City : Hudson, State :MA, Zip :(REDACTED).Email Address (REDACTED).Phone Number :(REDACTED)"

No guarantee that an out of warranty coverage will come of this feedback. 13b17 CSP is a covered repair that needs to be performed by dealer.

CUST SAYS: ..See previous case notes...The power steering service - she had to get it towed to a dlrshp. Since then, she read online that many other people are having the same problem and there is a class action suit on it. Sometimes they have to replace the rack and pinion other times they have to replace the entire steering problem. She said that she is panicked now because of all the information she is reading on the internet. She said that Ford is being very stubborn about it and not fix it. She said the veh is at the dlrshp now, but they won't diagnose it until Monday. She wants to know what is wrong with her veh..... PER CUST, DLR SAYS: Winner Ford, Cherry Hill .. N/A.. .. CRC ADVISED: ..I advised her that the dlrshp will have to diagnose the concern. I advised her that she can get the veh diagnosed there and they cannot do any repairs without her consent. I advised that the repairs come with a 2 year/unlimited mileage warranty and the repairs are done by Ford factory-trained technicians and they use genuine Ford parts on the repairs...She isn't sure she wants Ford to do the repair because she is afraid of the cost of the repair. But then she said that she was at the dlrshp looking for a new Fusion. I advised that she would be responsible for the cost because the veh is outside of warranty. I also advised that if a recall or CSP comes out with regard to this concern, she could possibly be reimbursed. She is making a lot of speculations based on what she read online. She is thinking of joining the class-action lawsuit that she read about.

By  - Hello, vehicle has a failed power steering rack. Very hard to steer. Customer has CPO Powertrain warranty which does not cover the steering gear. Dealer quoted retail estimate and guest got very upset. Guest is aware of, and brought to dealer's attention, news reports of NHTSA investigation on this car for this complaint. Dealer explained it is not, and never may be a recall. Guest is adamant she is due factory assistance. Estimate at warranty rates is 1324.00. Customer is reasonably loyal to our dealer group, visiting both our store and our sister store, Palm Springs Motors. Please advise if assistance is available, thank you.
LTV NS ..Veh purchased used (CPO)....I can contribute $900 towards the repair costs.
By  - Holy Bat Cave! Thanks for the super fast reply, like 4 minutes!! We'll present it to the guest, thanks a mil Mel...

CUST. SAYS:..1 month ago power steering when out. She paid $830.27 for the power steering module bought from Ford dealer, but was installed by independent. Same issue is occurring again and she requests that we provide reimbursement on the part itself from last month's repair because she heard issue is common on 2012 Fusion vehicles.....PER CUST. DLR SAYS:..n/a....CRC ADVISED:..We cannot provide reimbursement on the part from last months repair because at this time there are no out of warranty coverages through any recalls. If there is an out of warranty coverage in the future to include your veh, then we will let you know by mail and that is when you can seek possible reimbursement. At this time, we can only cover the part currently under SPW 2 years coverage. To seek SPW coverage, pleas contact Ford dealer parts dept to order the part again. I transferred her to dealer.
CUST SAYS:..Cust states that he purchased this veh 1 year ago and there has been an ongoing issue with the power steering. Cust states that it has been getting steadily worse. Cust states that he took veh to a dlr in Indiana, who told him that it was related to tire pressure and to keep note of it. Cust states that 1 week ago, the power steering went completely out. Cust states that he is upset over the repair not being taken care of 1 year ago when this started.....PER CUST, DLR SAYS:..Dlr states that veh needs a new electronic power steering rack at a cost of $1200. ....CRC ADVISED:..CSR verified contact information. CSR advised that veh is out of b2b warranty, which would have covered repair. CSR advised that there are no warranties/recalls/programs to assist with this repair.
CUSTOMER SAYS: ..Power steering was going in and out intermittently and last week it went out all together. Warranty has expired. Looking for financial assistance. Purchased used. .. ..PER CUSTOMER, DEALER SAYS: ..Power steering rack is gone and needs to be replaced. $1200 to repair... ..CRC ADVISED: ..After reviewing my resources, there are no warranties or programs in effect that would provide coverage of your current concern. I recommend that you keep your receipts in case Ford initiates a program in the future based on your situation that you may be eligible for a refund or reimbursement.
CUST. SAYS:..He is upset we are not covering anything on his power steering rack repair. There is a pending class action lawsuit on this issue and he wants to know our stance no that toward this issue.....PER CUST. DLR SAYS:..$1200 for repair cost on replacing steering gear rack.....CRC ADVISED:..At this time, your veh is out of all applicable warranties and has no outside warranties through recall or CSP's to provide coverage or assistance from FMC in repair. Although there is a pending lawsuit, we cannot comment on that as nothing has became official on it. I documented your feedback to Ford Engineering for review. If our Ford Executives feel in the future that an out of warranty program should be on this issue to include your veh, then you will be notified by mail and can then seek possible reimbursement for repair you are paying for if it relates to the same repair procedure. In the meantime we recommend you have your veh diagnosed by your local Ford dlr for proper repair, but a diag fee will be charged first before a repair quote will be given. You can also put in your complaint into nhtsa.gov website.

Supervisor, please call Mr. Tom Owens at 317-727-0023.
OBC to the cust, (REDACTED) - Left a detailed VM: This msg is for Mr. Owens. Sir, this is Jalissa - A supervisor with FMC calling in regards to your case number, 5340899. This is in reference to your 2012 Ford Fusion. Sir, I was hoping to speak with you directly; however, I was unable to reach you and will be attempting you again by COB tmrw. Again, your case number is 5340899. Thank you.
OBC to the cust, (REDACTED) - Identified myself as a supervisor and cust confirmed it was a good time to discuss. Advised that the call is being recorded for quality/training purposes.....Reviewed the situation with the customer, receiving confirmation that he is seeking assistance from FMC for the power-steering and has continued to call in to request it. He claims that the issue has been ongoing for over a year, yet the dlrships were unable to diagnose it. Now, he is facing a large bill for the part/repairs because the power-steering has completely gone out. He made mention of another veh manufacturer offering better customer service for a different veh and a different issue (transmission), comparing them to FMC's poor service. It was explained to the cust that his claim has been investigated to the fullest extent. We assessed the life of the veh and checked for programs/ESPs on the veh that may be able to aid him in coverage; however, as he has been advised in the past- There is no coverage that can be offered for his repairs. We encourage him to save his receipts in the case of a program in the future where he can submit to Ford for reimbursement assessment. He asked where he could submit further complaints about FMC's service, and I offered the NHTSA phone number which he declined. Explained that we are sorry for not meeting his expectations, but the case is officially closed. There would be no further discussion on this through CRC, as the resolution will not change. Provided my name to him, per his request, and provided his case number.....Closing case.

CUST SAYS: ..The SM said Ford will not be able to provide assistance. ..PER CUST, DLR SAYS:....CRC ADVISED:..Explained to cust how the process works. ..We do empower our dealerships to allocate funds on a case by case basis to assist in lowering or absorbing the cost of potential repairs that are beyond warranty. However, we provide our dealerships guidelines in terms of allocating these funds.
CUSTOMER SAYS: ..Cust stated that power steering went out. CRC rep Jamelle advised that dlr makes decisions and there is nothing on the case... ..PER CUST, DLR SAYS: ..Out of warranty by time. SA Mark advised they got a no for assistance and that an area reps makes decision for assistance. All they got was a no and the area rep never got involved... ..CRC ADVISED: ..I advised cust that both Jamelle and the dlr are correct. FMC does provide guidelines to dlr for use of funds that are allocated for providing assistance to customers. Dlrs do work with regional managers to review for possible programs for repair coverage. If the veh is outside of warranty and there is not a recall that has been issued for this concern, there must be another type of program available to cover the cost of this repair. If no such program exists, the cost of repair is the responsibility of the of owner of the veh. I advised cust to speak with SM directly about this case. There are no notes on case from SM. If CSM needs to get involved, dlr must reach out to CSM. CSM does not automatically get involved in these cases.

CUST SAYS:.. Cust has not yet received a follow up. There wa a power steering problem. The steering locked up. Cust had to pay $500 for parts before the veh was repaired and it took a week. They never called back. Cust does not want her car fixed at this dlrshp and wants her money back. Cust called in yesterday and was expecting a follow up. Additionally, the previous rep said that parts can be returned. Cust does not have her previous case number but it was not only a couple letters. Cust does not trust the dlrshp. The service has been terrible. They are unethical and dishonest. Cust asked why she was told differently before and asked why she was told differently yesterday and asked to speak to the department that reviews this information. Cust requested to speak to my supervisor. ....PER CUST, DLR SAYS:.. They had to order parts. Cust had to pay for the parts in advance because they are nonrefundable.

There is a 13b17 CSP to be done too.....CRC ADVISED:..Your veh is out of all applicable warranties for a steering issue and has no outside warranties through recall or CSP's to provide coverage or assistance from FMC in repair. I documented your feedback to Ford Engineering for review. If our Ford Executives feel in the future that an out of warranty program should be on this issue to include your veh, then you will be notified by mail and can then seek possible reimbursement for repair you are paying for if it relates to the same repair procedure. In the meantime we recommend you have your veh diagnosed by your local Ford dlr for proper repair, but a diag fee will be charged first before a repair quote will be given. No guarantee that an out of warranty coverage will come of this feedback. 13b17 CSP is a covered repair that needs to be performed by dealer.

It has gone out while the veh was moving. They had to pull over, shut the veh off and then restart it. Other than that, he loves the veh. Veh has been in to Goodyear, they told her to bring the veh back in when the power steering fails..... PER CUSTOMER, DEALER SAYS: .. N/A.... CRC ADVISED: .. I advised Mr Shelburne that the veh is still covered under the powertrain warranty and that he has Roadside Assistance available to him at no cost. He said he saw online that it is safe to drive the veh for short distances and wanted to know if that is correct. I advised that I am not technically trained and cannot answer that question. I advised that Roadside could pick the veh up from his house and take it to the dlrshp. I advised that there aren't any recalls on his veh (I advised of the CSP). I transferred him to the dlrshp to make an appt and then advised him to make arrangements with Roadside to come and pick up the veh.

CUST SAYS: .. While driving down the road the power steering went out on his veh. The veh is at the dlrshp right now. It cost him $2,000. This is his last Ford.

I have researched the problem and it appears this is a rather common occurrence in the Fusion and Ford has issued recalls for other vehicles using similar EPS systems but not the Fusion. This is unacceptable to allow a known problem posing such a danger to go unchecked by Ford. This could have killed my wife as she barely was able to control the vehicle. This vehicle is only four years old and as stated before this is a known problem by your company. The replacement price for the power steering rack alone should be enough to cause Ford to address the problem as it causes undue hardship on owners outside of warranty. I own three other Ford vehicles and have been a loyal Ford owner all my life, I would like to not regret that decision. .WHAT ACTION HAS YOUR DEALER TAKEN TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE?:Nothing as of yet as I cannot afford to replace the system. .WHAT ASSISTANCE ARE YOU SEEKING FROM FORD MOTOR COMPANY?:I would like to see Ford take some steps to address this issue with their electric power steering units in the Fusion. If Ford does not feel a recall is in order I feel that Ford should at least replace these units as they fail even though this still poses a threat to drivers when they fail. For my issue I would at least appreciate Ford extending me a Ford service credit line to be able to afford to fix this issue in my vehicle. This is our primary means of conveyance for work and family. .Are you the owner of the vehicle :Yes.VIN : 3FAHP0HA5ARXXXXXX.MILEAGE : 136,560.WHERE IS YOUR VEHICLE NOW : InPossession.HAVE YOU CONTACTED THE DEALER :Yes.DEALER NAME : First Place Ford..Contact Information.First Name : (REDACTED) .Last Name (REDACTED).Address (REDACTED0. .City : Lenoir , State :NC, Zip :(REDACTED).Email Address (REDACTED).Phone Number :(REDACTED)

Went to dealer ..There are several items on the internet about these same warning light sequences. At this point just wants us to b e aware of what is going on. He obtained out number from Ford Owner - was difficult to find though.....PER CUST DEALER SAYS: ..The passenger side tire has a small leak in side wall. Needs to be replaced. No problems with tie rod, not yet sure what is happening. ....CRC ADVISED: ..Thank you for contacting FMC. I will document your concerns. Your local Ford/Lincoln dealership has factory-trained technicians, the most current engineering service information, and the specialized equipment required to resolve your vehicle concerns. We recommend you stay in contact with the service manager at the dealership
CUST SAYS:..My electric power steering went out and thinks that Ford should fix this. ....Took veh two weeks ago to Florence White Ford as veh was making a knocking and grinding sound in the steering. Scott Young the SA was not able to find anything wrong with power steering...Steering linkages and balls joint may require future attention. ....I do not want to go back to Florence White Ford. ....CUST SAYS DLR SAYS:..Nothing wrong with power steering. ....CRC ADVISED:..Obc to dlr Florence White Ford:..Spoke with Scott:..Last time she was here was May 7th. Concern of noise that the steering/suspension makes. Found lower ball joints were comprised. Nothing on the power steering. ....Recommended diagnosis for power steering and to contact FMC back for further assistance.
CUST SAYS:..Mr Williams realizes his 2012 Fusion is not associated with the recent power steering recalls, but he is experiencing a similar issue. PS will fail, reactivates with a restart.....PER CUST, DLR SAYS:..Techs note that until the diagnostic reads positive for a faulty sensor, etc., they can find no issue to repair.....AGENT ADVISED:..I advised that should he have the opportunity, when next it fails, he should take it to the dlr to get it diagnosed. We discussed warranty expiration based on mileage, and I noted that I would make note of his issue in our system as well.
CUST SAYS: ..Bill Fauzio and his business partner bought brand new 2012 Ford Fusion in August of 2011...3-4 months ago he was backing up and the steering was super tight. alarm went off indicator told him that there is a problem . Then again a few months later same problem happened again . Driver seat belt is fraying as well. Cust was calling to see if we could help him out with paying for this part.....PER CUST DLR SAYS:..Dealership and looked at the vehicle with the electronic steering system. $2300 cost of repair ....CRC: ..Advised the cust that he is outside of all warranties, and regrettably Ford Motor Company will not assist with this concern. Advised the cust that if he chooses to have this repair to please keep all receipts in case we issue a recall or Csp.
CUST SAYS: ..Vehicle lost power steering while son was driving.....PER CUST DLR:..Gave her phone numbers to call for help but they weren't correct.....CRC ADVISED:..Not involved in the 14S05, so I transferred customer to CRC for more assistance with vehicle concern.
CUST SAYS: ..Power Steering is failing. The prompt that comes up on the msg screen says power steering assist failure. This started back on May 5th while she was driving. She was making a U-turn when the power steering went out. It wasn't a sharp U-turn that she was making. She did some research - if you Google it, all kinds of Ford chat sites come up. It seems there is a problem with the parts Ford is getting from their supplier. The second time this happened - the veh has been parked at home since May 13th. She has not had an opportunity to address this concern until now. She took the veh to one Ford dlrshp. Her experience with them was unpleasant. She would like to take the veh to another dlrshp.....PER CUSTOMER, DEALER SAYS: ..N/A....CRC ADVISED: ..I advised her that she needs to have the veh diagnosed by a Ford dlrshp first. I advised her of Galpin Ford and she stated she will be happy to take her veh there. I provided her with the phone number to the service dept and transferred her there to make an appt for diagnosis/service.
By Steve Walker - Advisor left message for customer regarding repair RO 740640 Line #1: verified concern retrieved code u3000 recommending to replace steering gear (internal failure) and 4 wheel alignment. Havent received a response from customer as of yet.
CUST SAYS..Took it to Carlock Ford and they said that the control arms needed to be fixed. Took it to another mechanic and they said the rack and pinion are stripped. The dlrshp charged over $100 for a bad diagnostic. Wants ford to pay for the rack and pinion on the veh since this is clearly a design flaw according to the reports online and this is a safety issue that must be addressed. Why hasn't ford initiated a recall regarding this?....PER CUST DLRSHP SAYS..It is the control arm that needs to be repaired.....CRC ADVISED..No recalls or programs that would provide coverage. We would suggest getting a second opinion at a ford dlrshp since they have the factory trained technicians. We will document this and if there is a recall through nhtsa or ford then you will receive notification by mail.

Just saw on the news about the recall for the power steering. ....PER CUSTOMER DEALER SAYS: ..cost to repair is $1600, because veh is just outside warranty will split cost 80/20....CRC ADVISED:..Regrettably the media does not educate that recalls are specific to the VIN as it depends on where and when the veh is manufactured as to whether or not its included in the program. There are no recalls currently on veh. Recommended retaining receipts in case Ford initiates a program in the future based upon this situation. Glad to hear that the dealer is willing to help out with the repair cost.

email to customer ....(REDACTED)Thank you for returning my phone call. I understand completely sometimes it is hard for both of use to make contact due to the time difference. ....I am a regional customer service manager for Ford and my role is to assist my dealers to address your concerns. ..You contacted out Customer Relationship Center regarding your 2010 Fusion with approximately 70,000 miles. ....I see by your letter that you purchased the part off Ebay and installed it yourself. ....Mr. Carbajal, unfortunately I am not able to reimburse you for the part, as you purchased a used part from Ebay. If you had taken your vehicle to a local dealer they may have been a chance that I could have assisted in the repair. ....I do apologize that I am not able to provide a reimbursement.....Thank you for contacting Ford Motor Company and if you have any future concerns please work with your local dealership, as they are in the best position to assist you.....Regards
RE Case 4105805.msg
silent f/u 3/26
email from customer ....Hi Judy, 3/19/14..In your reply you write (REDACTED), unfortunately I am not able to reimburse you for the part, as you purchased a used part from Ebay. If you had taken your vehicle to a local dealer they may have been a chance that I could have assisted in the repair. ..This makes me think that nobody ever even read my letters. In everyone of my correspondence letters, I never asked for reimbursement of the part, only the labor done at the local Ford dealership(American Ford, Glendive, MT)(I sent a copy of that invoice..if lost I can send another). I did mention that it would be nice to be covered for the part too but the labor is what I'm after. The reason I did not buy the part from the dealership was that Ford wanted $1200 for it. Ebay wanted $200. The labor was simply programming the new part and the required alignment. As I have said many times, I am asking for the reimbursement of the labor not the part...Please read all seven emails and the written letter with paid Ford Dealership invoice that I have sent. Thanks, Greg
CAS-4105805-V4Q8W4.msg
email from cust 3/19....OK thanks- I get the feeling that nobody really knows what's going on and maybe that's Ford's plan.....-I didn't attempt to fix the car. I did fix the car...-I took it to the Ford dealership because a new or used steering rack install requires an alignment and a computer flash. That would have been done whether the I or the dealership installed it. That's the money I am trying to recoup...I get the feeling you just flat out don't want to cover that $279 no matter what. The fact that I installed the part(or that it is used) has nothing to do with the labor I'm asking you to cover. ..You can choose not to pay I guess. When I take my car to the dealership they won't give me my car back until I pay. Then I have to go through all of this to get my money back? I don't get to choose...The only recourse I have left, I guess, is to move away from Ford. I know this all happens with other makers as well....but for $279 you have lost me, my family and perhaps even some people I tell about this. I have never asked for money back on a repair for a car. This one seems so premature and obviously due to a flaw that I feel it fair to request payment...Greg
email to customer ....(REDACTED) ....IΓÇÖm sorry that I am not providing you with the resolution you are looking for. I am not able to reimburse for the repairs completed at the dealership. ....Regards

CUSTOMER SAYS:..He wanted to know what to do about his vehicle because he is having a problem with the steering. It takes a lot of effort to turn the wheel.....PER CUSTOMER DEALER SAYS:..His epas assembly is no good and it is part of rack and pinion. Estimate would be 1273.00. Not covered under warranty.....CRC ADVISED:..There are no programs or warranties in effect that would cover the cost of the repair at this time. Advised him to keep his receipts for future possible reimbursement if Ford generates a recall.
CUST SAYS:..He stated that he sent numerous emails and bill even regular mail to FMC to recover funds for service on faulty electric power steering but he felt that he is being ignored.

CUST SAYS:..I had my oil changed and the next morning my low tire pressure light was on, as was my service advance tracking and service power steering soon was on. By the time I got of work, it said advance tracking now and service power steering now. I drove to dlrshp w/o power steering. ....I have to replace my power steering. I have gone online and saw 60 -70 people with exact same thing. This should be a recall. I'm contacting my attorney and we will sue. I need your name and badge number. Is there anyone higher than you I can speak with? ....I don't mind paying for normal wear and tear items, but this is ridiculous. ....PER CUST, DRLSHP SAYS:..$1800 to replace power steering. ....CRC ADVISED:..I have reviewed if there are any warranties extension on the vehicle and I am not seeing any. I have also checked to see if there are any Extended Service Plan active on the vehicle and there are none at this time. IΓÇÖm not showing any recalls or customer satisfaction programs for this concern with the vehicle either. Regrettably, Ford would not be able to offer any assistance toward the cost of this repair. I have, however, documented the concerns you are experiencing. This information will be reviewed internally and is available to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for possible future recall information. I encourage you to keep your receipts in case a recall is issued and you may be eligible for reimbursement.

CUSTOMER SAYS:..Having a problem with the power steering. It is really hard to turn....PER CUSTOMER DEALER SAYS:..have not been to the dlr....CRC ADVISED:....The BTB has expired it is 3/36, the veh is still within the powertrain 5/60. There are no ESP on the veh. There are no power steering components covered under the powertrain warranty, it covers components of the engine, transmission and front or rear wheel drive. I would recommend taking the veh to the dlr for them to diagnose the concern.
CUST SAYS:..Low tire pressure lite was on in veh and had the tire repaired. Tire was patched.....A day and one half later the Power assist fault lite came on in veh. ..When I googled this, several posts came up because of tire pressure or nail in tire. ....Has an appt. at dlr. I do not feel like the dlrshp is taking this issue seriously. I want this documented and I want to know if you have heard of this issue. ....CUST SAYS DLR SAYS:....CRC ADVISED:..We recommend that your vehicle be inspected by a Ford/Lincoln dealership to determine the cause of any symptoms your vehicle may be experiencing. Your local Ford/Lincoln dealership has factory-trained technicians, the most current engineering service information, and the specialized equipment required to resolve your vehicle concerns. If there is no coverage under applicable warranties, recalls, or ESPs, repairs and services would be your responsibility. Your next step is to make an appointment with your servicing dealership to have your vehicle diagnosed.
Agent could not close case. Kept getting an Error Retrieving ETC Code .
CUST SAYS..He just had to have the power steering motor replaced. He has talked with the dealer and they said that since he was just over the BTB, that he should talk with Ford about getting this covered under warranty. He had to pay almost $1800 for the repair. He is going to contact the NHTSA because this is unacceptable. He can't believe that Ford is not going to stand behind its product.....PER CUST DLR SAYS..N/A....CRC ADV..There are no programs or warranties in effect that would provide coverage for your concern.

If you had taken your vehicle to a local dealer they may have been a chance that I could have assisted in the repair. ..This makes me think that nobody ever even read my letters.

I did mention that it would be nice to be covered for the part too but the labor is what I'm after. The reason I did not buy the part from the dealership was that Ford wanted $1200 for it. Ebay wanted $200. The labor was simply programming the new part and the required alignment.

The fact that I installed the part(or that it is used) has nothing to do with the labor I'm asking you to cover. ..You can choose not to pay I guess. When I take my car to the dealership they won't give me my car back until I pay. Then I have to go through all of this to get my money back? I don't get to choose...The only recourse I have left, I guess, is to move away from Ford.
